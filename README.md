# apiTest

## Overview

This project is about API automation with [Karate DSL](https://github.com/karatelabs/karate) of some of the services from [reqres](https://reqres.in/).<br/>

## Requirements

This project is written down in [IntelliJ](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/).<br/>
I used Karate version 1.0.0. If you want to use this version, add dependency from [here](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.intuit.karate/karate-junit5/1.0.0).<br/>
[Cucumber For Java](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/7212-cucumber-for-java/versions) and [Gherkin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/9164-gherkin) plugins should be installed for syntax.<br/>
Also you can use this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-KOJ12Dbxrk) for installation of Karate.<br/>

You can run the tests with ApiTestRunner class.
